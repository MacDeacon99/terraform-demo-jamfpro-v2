# Terraform Demo for Jamf Pro V2

## Overview

This repository contains an example automated workflow for using Terraform to manage Jamf Pro configuration across multiple environments in a Route To Live (RTL) arrangement. This example leverages the [Jamf Pro Terraform Provider](https://github.com/deploymenttheory/terraform-provider-jamfpro) and Hashicorp Terraform Cloud Workspaces. The workflows found here automate the planning, application and release process of your changes - ensuring only tested, versioned and approved code reaches production in the same state it was tested in.
